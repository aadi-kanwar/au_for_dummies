# General Information
This is the most important section of this guide, so don't miss a single word. Read every bit as if your campus survival depends on it—because it just might!

### ID Card
This article is **super important**. Think of your ID card as your golden ticket—no ID, no entry, no fun! You'll need it to get onto campus, so don’t let it wander off. Treat it like a VIP pass to the coolest club in town because, without it, you'll be left outside like a puppy in the rain. 

Plus, it's all about keeping the campus safe and sound from unauthorized party crashers. So, seriously, guard that ID like it’s the last slice of pizza at a college party!

Your ID card is your magic key to many places on campus. One such place is the library. Want to get lost in a good book? You'll need your ID card to gain access. And if you find that perfect book you can't put down, you'll need it again to check it out. So, keep that ID handy—your literary adventures depend on it!

### Attendance
According to University policy, all students need to keep their attendance at a minimum of **75%** in every subject to be eligible for the exams. So, unless you want to be a ghost at your own exams, make sure you show up to class! Remember, being present is half the battle—literally.

Your attendance percentage will earn you some extra marks. So, think of showing up to class as collecting bonus points just for being there!

Students are totally allowed to carry smartphones!

Please refrain from using smartphones during classes. If caught, the college authorities might just keep your phone **hostage** until they decide to set it free. So, keep your gadgets tucked away and focus on acing those lectures!
